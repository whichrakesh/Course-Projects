Task 0:
1. Which command was used to create the LAN? What are its arguments? How was the MAC protocol specified?
A: set lan ( parameters for the lan: simulator, Lan name, nodelist, delay, llctype(logic layer type), interface queue type(ifq), mactype, channel type and option for tracefile.
Mac protocol was specified by firstly defining a mac protocol “set opt(mac) Mac/802_3” and then using it in argument while creating lan.


2. What is the data rate (bandwidth) of the LAN? Remember this - this an important parameter.
A: 1Mbps


3. What is the packet size (bytes) used in the generated traffic? Where is the offered rate set?
A: Packet size is 1000 B. Offered rate per node is set to 100Kbps.


4.  What is the duration of the simulation when traffic is active?
A: 10s


Q.What is the expected transfer time of a packet on this link (propagation delay is being ignored)?
A: 0.008s.


Q. When are the packets actually received?
A: 0.0082s


Q. One computes the overall throughput 
 Find the throughput of the 4-node experiment, see if it  makes sense.
A: throughput = 401.836 Kbps


Q.  One computes delays
○ From enqueue to deque (time in the interface queue)
A: Average interface delay = 0s
○ From deque to receive (time of transmission including backoff)
A: Average travel delay = 0.0235192


Task1: 
See what happens when there is only one node
● Look at the throughput, the delays
throughput :  100.724 Kbps
which decreases due to the number of nodes being reduced to 1. The throughput is approx equals to the bw of the node.  
● Understand the numbers to the extent 
possible
Average iface delay =  0 Average travel delay = 0.008116. All  delays are the same.
The travel delay decreases due to less accident. 


Task 2:
Q.Given the bandwidth of 1Mbps, how many nodes should  this LAN ideally support?
A: 10 nodes
Q.What is the ideal max throughput (roughly)?
A: 100Kb/s per node


Task 4:
Q.What is each node’s throughput? What is the total?
A: node 2 : 426.958Kbps
    node 1: 437.356Kbps
        Total : 842.798 Kbps
Q.Now change Node 1’s offered rate to 900 kbps
        Now what is each node’s throughput? What is the total?
A. node 1: 627.075 Kbps
     node 2: 300.139 Kbps
        total: 890.969Kbps
