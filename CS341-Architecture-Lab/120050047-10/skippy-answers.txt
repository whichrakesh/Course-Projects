(In graph all times are in seconds)
Interpretation = Here key is to factor out disk rotation effects by making consecutive seeks to indiviual sectors with address that differ by a linearly increasing amount.
Here there is high peak in the graph when there is a head switch. Among these high peaks there is a higher peak whenever there is cylinder switch. The number of heads in the cylinder can be found by calculating the number of head switches between two  cylinder  switches.

What is the minimum rotation time? Maximum rotation time? Average rotation time?
maximum rotation latency = 22ms
minimum rotation latency = few ms
avg rotation latency = 10.0 ms 

What is the head switch time?
Its the smallest peaks of the graph: 2.0 ms

What is the track switch time?
The track switch time corresponds to the next bigger peaks which occur among the small peaks: 5ms.

How many heads does your hard disk have? Does the reading from your graph roughly match with the reading from using “fdisk -l”?
from the graph, we can find the number of heads by calculating the number of peaks between two consecutive cylinder switches. It came out to be 19. 
It is very different than the output of "fdisk -l" which gives 63 heads.
