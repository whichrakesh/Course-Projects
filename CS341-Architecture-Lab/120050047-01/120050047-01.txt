Question [1 mark]: 
	In the xspim window, identify the various parts of the screen which you can understand; also identify the parts which you cannot understand (as yet).
Answer:
	the first screen shows the value of the registers.
	second screen(Text segments) shows the assembly and the machine codes for our code instructions.
	The third screen(Data segments) shows Global Data, stack and kernel data.
	The fourth screen segment shows logs, Warning and errors in the code while it runs.
	I could not understand properly the 3rd screen segment.
	
Question [0.5 marks]: Identify the address at which your program begins. You can use the “print” “global symbols” button for this.
Answer: The program starts at 0x00400024

Question [0.5 marks]: Is “li” really a MIPS instruction? Its a pseudo-instruction. What does it get translated into?
Answer:	No "li" is not really a MIPS instruction. It gets translated to ori. The instruction or the integer with 0 to store the value in the required register.

Question [1 mark]: Identify the machine code of your instructions. Identify the op-codes (higher order 6 bits of the machine code) of the various instructions in your assembly code.
	li $t0,1 => 0x34080001 
	addi $t1,$t0,2 =>0x21090002
	li $v0,1 => 0x34020001
	move $a0,$t1 => 0x00092021
	syscall => 0x0000000c

	--opcodes--
	li => 001101
	addi => 001000
	move => 000000
	syscall => 000000
