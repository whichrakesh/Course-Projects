This is  the 
you will build a lexical analyser using the lexical analyser generator
tool flexc++. Specifically:

1. Study  the grammar.  From the grammar,  identify the tokens  of the
language.

2. Study the flexc++ manual. 

3. Write a  flexc++ script in a file called  lex.l.  This will contain
the regexps and the actions that will be used to specify the tokens of
the language.

3. Use flexc++ to generate the files Scanner.h, Scannerbase.h and lex.c.

4.   Use  a sedscript  similar  to  the  one  supplied to  insert  the
declaration of the tokens in Parser.h.

5. Compile the files lex.c and main.c (modified suitably).   

6. Run the resulting executable on example programs.
